## 💻 How to Use

Each problem in `C-Basic-150.c` is:
- **Commented out by default** - Uncomment the problem you want to run
- **Well-documented** - Includes problem statement and expected output
- **Self-contained** - Can be run independently
- **Tested** - Verified solutions with sample inputs/outputs

### Running a Specific Problem:
1. Open `C-Basic-150.c`
2. Find the problem you want to solve (they're numbered 1-150)
3. Uncomment the code block for that problem
4. Comment out any other active problems
5. Compile and run

## 🔧 Compilation Instructions

### Using GCC (Command Line):
```bash
gcc C-Basic-150.c -o C-Basic-150
./C-Basic-150
```

### Using GCC with Math Library (for mathematical problems):
```bash
gcc C-Basic-150.c -lm -o C-Basic-150
./C-Basic-150
```

### Using IDE:
- **Code::Blocks**: Open file → Build → Run
- **Dev-C++**: Open file → Execute → Compile & Run
- **Visual Studio Code**: Use C/C++ extension and configure build tasks
